# Alchemy 5e SRD

Welcome! This repository contains various files from the 5e SRD in formats friendly with [Alchemy](https://alchemyrpg.com). For additional developer information, please refer to the [Alchemy developer documentation](https://alchemyrpg.github.io/slate).

## NPCs

The SRD NPCs are available in the [`npcs`](/npcs) directory. Each NPC is available as an individual JSON document. There is also an [`_all.json`](/npcs/_all.json) file that contains all of the NPCs in a single document ready for bulk import.
